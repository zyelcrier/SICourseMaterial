    // and also print the longest of the words that includes the letter
    
        
    //TODO #1c - use a while loop from the previous for loop todo solve the problem using a while loop


    //JUST WHILE LOOPS
    //TODO #1 - use a while loop that prompts the user to guess a word until the word they input matches the word "sushi"

    //TODO #2 -  use a while loop to keep rolling a 6 sided die till the roll is 3

    //TODO #3a - roll a 6 sided  dice once save and  output the value 
    //note your going to need to store the sum of all dice rolls( so save the value of the roll to a variable that keeps track of sums)
    
    //TODO #3b - prompt/ask the user if they want to roll again (yes/no) 
    //if its yes set user choice to true
    

    //TODO #3c - keep rolling while the user choice is true and add all the values of the dice rolls to you sum variable
    // when the user enters anything but yes set user choice to false

    //TODO #4 - ask the user for a number use a while loop that loops while 
    //the number the user enters is less than a random number from 0 to 100 keep track of how many times it loops and print that number when the loop is done
    //hint you'll need two variables one for the random munber and one for the user number

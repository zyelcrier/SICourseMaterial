# Lab0331 - Arrays

## Problem Statement

Every XULA undergraduate must complete XULA's [XCore](http://webusers.xula.edu/aedwards/core/index.html) to graduate. XCore provides the foundation for a well-rounded education.  It has lots of courses but only a subset of those courses are needed.  What XCore courses should a student take and why?  By the end of this semester, we'll implement an **XCore Advisor App** to recommend XCore courses based on a student's interests and career plans.

Topics for this lab include lots and lots of functions and some introductory array problems.

**Solve the TODOs in the Lab0331.java file.**

    //WHILE AND FOR
    //TODO #1 - use a for loop that take a word from the user and prints it 5 times on the same line

    //TODO #1a - do the same thing from the previous todo but use a while loop

    //TODO #2 -  use a for loop that gets the largest number out of 8 numbers entered by the user

    //TODO #2a - do the same thing from the previous todo but use a while loop

    //TODO #3 - use a for loop  that multiplies all odd values entered in by the user  and saves them to one variable and return that 

    //TODO #3a - use a while loop from the previous for loop using while

    //JUST WHILE LOOPS
    //TODO #1 - use a while loop that prompts the user to guess a word until the word they input matches the word "sushi"

    //TODO #2 -  use a while loop to keep rolling a 6 sided die till the roll is 7 

    //TODO #3 -  prompt the user if they would like to do math (yes or no) set it to a boolean value

    //TODO #4 -  while the user choice is yes  inside your while loop as the user for two numbers and add them together 
    // out put answers in the following format { num1 + num2 = sum}
    // once the user has gotten their answer ask them again if they would like to do more math

    //TODO #5 - roll a 6 sided  dice output the value and ask the user if they want to roll again (yes/no) 
    //if its yes set user choice to true
    //note your going to need to store the sum of all dice rolls

    //TODO #5 - keep rolling while the user choice is true and add all the values of the dice rolls 
    // when the user enters anything but yes set user choice to false

    //TODO #6

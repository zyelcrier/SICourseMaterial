         //TODO #2 -  use a while loop to keep rolling a 6 sided die till the roll is 7

         //Hint remember boolean is either true or false
         
         //TODO #4 -  while the user choice is yes  inside your while loop as the user for two numbers and add them together 
         // out put answers in the following format { num1 + num2 = sum}
         // once the user has gotten their answer ask them again if they would like to do more math
         
         //TODO #5 - roll a 6 sided  dice output the value and ask the user if they want to roll again (yes/no) 
         //if its yes set user choice to true
         //note your going to need to store the sum of all dice rolls
            
         //TODO #6a - keep rolling while the user choice is true and add all the values of the dice rolls 
         // when the user enters anything but yes set user choice to false
        
         //Send a 3 in the chat when your done with these todos

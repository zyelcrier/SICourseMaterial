    //ONLY PRINT THE NUMBER IF IT IS A PERFECT SQUARE


    // TODO: #7 - Print the values of: 4x^2+2x-3: for values of x from -20 to 20.

    //TODO: #11 - Compute the sum of the individual digits of an integer.  For example, given 4096, the result should be 19.
    // Hint: successively use the modulus and div operators to break down the number into the individual digits


    //TODO: #12 - Determine whether an integer entered from the console is prime 
    //(a number is prime if it is evenly divisible only by 1 and itself). 
    //Hint: check whether the modulus of the number is zero for any integer from 2 to the square root of the number.

    //Assume that interest is compounded quarterly.

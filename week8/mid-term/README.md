### Mid-term
#### Each question is 10 points, 100 points total

1.	Create a new java program called EnterAndShowName.java. When it runs, the program prompts and reads the user's first and last name. The program then displays the last name, a comma, and the first name on a single line.

2.	Create a new java program called RollTwoDice.java. When it runs, the program rolls two 6-sided dice. If the same number is rolled twice, the program displays "Double {N}!" (replace {N} with the number that was rolled twice). If the rolls are different, the program adds the two values together and displays "You rolled {N1} and {N2}, that's {SUM}."

3.	Complete the java program called DreamSalary.java. When it runs, the program prompts and reads from the user their desired annual salary. The program computes the monthly amount required to reach that amount in a year and displays the message
That's ${formatted value} per month.
where the value is formatted to show commas and two decimal places. Note that the currency symbol is part of the literal, not part of the formatting.

4.	Complete the java program called PrintVertical.java. When it runs, the program prompts and reads from the user a single line of input, which may contain multiple words. The program displays the input vertically, in other words, one character per line. For example:

workspace$ java PrintVertical
What's your line? border terrier
b
o
r
d
e
r

t
e
r
r
i
e
r
workspace$

5.	Complete the Java program called ConversionTable.java. When it runs, the program displays a table with two columns, U.S. dollars and the equivalent British pounds. Show the dollar amounts starting at $100, ending at $500, in increments of $50. One dollar is 0.72 pounds. (Note that this problem does not have any input, it just prints a table.)

6.	Complete the Java program called AddFixedAmountOfValues.java. When it runs, the program prompts and reads from the user how many values to add up. The program reads that number of values and computes their sum. The program displays the sum after all the inputs are given.

7.	Complete the Java program called CountMultiples.java. When it runs, the program prompts and reads from the user a factor (the number to count multiples of). The program then counts how many randomly generated integers are multiples of the factor. The program displays the count after all the numbers are generated.

8.	Complete the java program called WriteValuesToFile.java. When it runs, the program prompts and reads a filename from the user and sends all randomly generated values to that file.

9.	Complete the java program called FunctionCall.java by adding a call statement for the function so that it executes when the program runs.

10.	Complete the java program called WriteAFunction.java by writing a void function to match the call statement in the main function. The function is supposed to accept two parameters and display their integer quotient and remainder. There is no return value.
